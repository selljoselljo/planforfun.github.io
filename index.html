<h2>Day 1 (9/4/17)</h2>
 <div class="body2">
 <p>It's 3:11 pm, Labor Day 2017.<br />
 <br />I am relearning html with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/" target="_blank">Friends</a> marathon on the background<br />
 To accomplish this, I am using free modules from <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">codecamedy</a>.<br />
 <br />Just under two hours later, with the finale of Friends on the background (<em>c/o TBS</em>), I learned:<br /><br />
  <ul>
   <li>Headings</li>
   <li>Lists</li>
   <li>Images</li>
   <li>Videos</li>
   <li>Links</li>
  </ul>
<h4>EOD Progress</h4>
 Added social media links, using photos. Learned some nav & id usage, but didn't apply. There's not enough content to require it.<br />
   Thanks, see you tomorrow.<br /><br />
 7:50 pm, almost 3 hrs later, just completed the final free module from <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">codecamedy</a>. It's called Tables + brief overview of styles with CSS
 Here's my Table<br /><br />
  <center><table>
   <thead>
    <tr>
     <th scope="col">Month & Year</th>
     <th scope="col">Destination</th>
     <th scope="col">Trip Highlight</th>
     <th scope="col">First Visit?</th>
     <th scope="col">Will Return?</th>
    </tr></thead>
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td>Nov 2016</td>
     <td>Central & NorCal</td>
     <td>Dungeness Crab for Thanksgiving</td>
     <td>No</td>
     <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Jan 2017</td>
     <td>Houston, TX</td>
     <td>NASA Space Station</td>
     <td>Yes</td>
     <td>Maybe</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>May 2017</td>
     <td>Las Vegas, NV</td>
     <td>Broke Even at the Casinos</td>
     <td>No</td>
     <td>Yes!</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Jan 2018</td>
     <td>St. Louis, LA</td>
     <td>TBD</td>
     <td>Yes</td>
     <td>We Shall See</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>May 2018</td>
     <td colspan="4">TBD</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Jun 2018</td>
     <td>Toronto, ONT</td>
     <td>TBD</td>
     <td>Yes</td>
     <td>Likely</td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
  </table></center>

<h2>Day 2 (9/5/17)</h2>
 <div class="body2"><p>Nothing but the sound of the keyboard tapping and the    Dyson fan in this warm afternoon. Glad it's no longer above 90 degrees F... Now it's somewhat more conducive to learning. <br />
  Yapping over. Learning actual CSS now. I swear I never learned this, but it looks somewhat familiar.<br /><br />
  Here goes nothing...<br /><br />
<h4>EOD Progress</h4>
  8:23 pm, learned selectors and visual rules. Selectors can be tricky, but probably because I have never used them, not that I know of. <br />
  Also, deleted some formatting that I haven't gotten to yet. Some parts of the Day 1 post might look different. <br />
<br />Bye for now. Gonna hang out with the idiot box.</p></div>

<h2>Day 3.5 (9/10/17)</h2>
 <div class="body2"><p>4pm-ish... Today and some of yesterday is all about boxes continuation of CSS.<br />
   Likely to see a change on tables and headings.<br />
   5:30 pm. I've been using just notepad to edit my code. Today I tried atom for the mac. It keeps crashing. Switch to sublime after about 20 crashes and a snack. Works just fine, but it asked me if I would like to purchase it. Seems normal, but I'm just a poor slob. I will link them next time, maybe.<br /><br />
   I'm having issues with the list and the rest of Day 1, it would not include itself in the paragraph box. Hoping to find resolution by the end of this session. <-- turns out this is a stupid hick-up. Should have been using div class this whole time.
   <h4>EOD Progress</h4>
   6:30 pm. Just added some color. Next lesson is more boxes. Quitting for the day. Bye.</p></div>

<h2>Day 4 (9/17/17, early morning)</h2>
 <div class="body2"><p>Today, this early morning, I did not study. But I added an about me page with a youtube video; which is not about me.
   <h4>EOD Progress</h4>
   1:30 am. Finish my 2nd page and updated this learning journal. Pretty soon everything will look better. I hope.</p></div>

<h2>Day 4.5 (9/17/17, daytime)</h2>
<div class="body2"><p>This lesson is about floats and position. I made some changes to the site but in the end decided not to commit them. I ran into some errors that kind of killed the site. I will try again, maybe tomorrow.
  <h4>EOD Progress</h4>
7pm. No change, just updated the about me page and added this entry.</p></div>

<h2>Day 5 (9/24/17)</h2>
<div class="newbody2"><p>Today is about colors and typography. So, this might look different at the end of the session. Forgive the latest post, still picking colors.
  <h4>EOD Progress</h4>
 Simply changed colors and added a new class for new entries, just for color variety. Also changed some fonts just for fun, and because the last module was about typography. Just for the new entries, I am using a free font from google: Architects Daughter. It will look weird, but I probably won't change it for a while.<br /><br />
 Next round of modules if python and ruby. Probably won't work on it until next weekend.<br /><br />
 See yah.</p></div>

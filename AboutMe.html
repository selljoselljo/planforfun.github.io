	<p><h4>Hello everyone.</h4><br />
I am a curious person always trying out and looking for new hobbies. Most recently, I started playing video games. My favorites are categorized under (turns out this they are called) tower defense games. I keep going back to Kingdom Rush. Sometimes it's also fun to have somewhat bad hearing. The first time I built an archer tower, it announced "archers ready!"; of course, I heard "nachos ready!". I play the games on steam, in a PC. I also like puzzle games such as The Room and Professor Layton (played the first one when I had a DS).<br /><br />
During winter of 2004, I arrived in the US with my parents. We landed at SFO from MNL. It was cold. (I will refer to arrivals and departures by airport code, it's just my way of being efficient). We lived with my uncle and his family. I worked at McDonalds for a month. Then we moved to Los Angeles with my grandparents.<br /><br />
I immediately started school, and also travelled to Toronto before I can even fully immerse myself into my new home city. In 2008 the housing market crashed, I graduated in 2009. Unlike some of my classmates, I didn't have a fellowship or job waiting for me. I had a job at a lousy hotel by Disneyland and two more classes to graduate with a management minor. So, I went to summer school and worked at the hotel. Just after I completed summer classes, the country still deep in you know what, I got a job as a drafter. It was a fun dead end job; I still occassionally took work from them after I left for a "better" job.<br /><br />
Fastforward to 2017. I am working fulltime with benefits for a great company and for a great client. If I ever complain, it's because nothing is ever perfect. But all in all, I am glad I survived the latest economic recession.<br /><br />
Some of my other hobbies include travelling, photography and trying new food and restuaraunts. <br /><br />
The first trip I went to by myself (the only one as a minor) was when I went to Seoul with the Catholic Scouts from the Philippines. I went with a few teachers and about 20 other students/scouts. We slept in tents in the mountains for several days and then stayed with foster families in the city the last few days of the trip. We went to Lotte World and had some kimchi. I love spicy and sour food, but I do not like kimchi at all.<br/><br/>
For me, there was always a curiosity with taking photos. But I never studied it until a few years back. Most of the photos in my instagram are of food. If it's not good quality, it's because I am more excited about tasting it than photographing it. I have some trip photos, but for the most part it's all about food.<br/><br/>
I also made this with my mom:<br/>
